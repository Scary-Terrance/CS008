    	<p>Sewage leaks can be a serious problem in Vermont. Sanitation workers in Vermont try their hardest to keep up with the heavy rains and melting snows in the spring. However, due to climate change, flooding is getting worse each year in Vermont — and severely outdated equipment leaks remain a serious problem. Fortunately this is not untreated sewage escaping, but water from the storm drains. This storm drain water contains toxins and runoff from the roads such as motor oil. When the leaks occur these toxins flow downstream polluting Vermont’s lakes.</p> 

		<p>Left unchecked, the dilapidated sewage system can cause significant harm to Vermont’s ecosystem, such as furthering the spread of cyanobacteria, otherwise known as blue-green algae blooms. This is a treat not just to Vermont’s aquatic habitats, but also to the state’s economy, which is largely driven by lake recreation in the summer. 

		Many of the plants in the state were built in the 1970’s and have received no major renovations since then. This problem will only be solved with major upgrade to Vermont wastewater facilities. Voters need to pressure their representatives in order to find a solution to this problem.  Which will only be possible with increased voter awareness.  Articles such as the one by VPR or this one, as well as alerts of sewage leaks help to spread awareness so this problem can be solved.  For a state as dependent on it’s lakes and waterways, Vermont should have water pollution as a top priority.</p>

		<p>This is why I created the Node JS VT Sewage bot.  The bot is built in Node JS, a platform which lets programmers run javascript on the backend of a server.  The bot then uses HTTP requests to scrape government a government we posts updates to twitter using the Twitter API.  Bots such as this help to make important information more accessible, by sharing to more platforms frequented by the public.  The code for this bot is open source and can be found here </p><a href=”https://github.com/Scary-Terrance/Node-SewageBot”>Node-SewageBot</a>
