        <p>My life changed drastically just about three years ago. I packed up my car, drove across the country and stumbled into a quaint city with friendly people and a beautiful waterfront. That’s how I ended up making my home in Vermont. After just a few days I had found an apartment and a job — and just a few months later, I fulfilled my long-time  goal of enrolling in college.</p>

        <p>That’s what it means to be a self starter. I didn’t resettle my life because of a job, a relationship, family or any external pressures. I knew I’d live a happier life outside of the fierce competition, suffocating traffic, and non-stop bustle of the Silicon Valley and I made it happen.</p>

        <p>This is the same way I approach my work. Going all the way back to junior high, I’ve been coding in my spare time — simply for the love of it. Then that lead into robotics and video game design. By trying tons of new programming-related things, I found that loving something is the easiest way to excel at it. I’ve continued to use that love — and a lot of hard work — to propel myself towards my educational and career goals. In my 3 years of school, I’ve created everything from a web-scraping Twitter posting bot to a robotic cat LASER toy — consistently performing beyond the assignment at hand to keep myself challenged. I’ve made Dean’s List each semester.</p>

        <p>I thrive on new technologies, learning new frameworks and methods. I’m always anticipating what’s coming next. In that way, I’ve easily established roote in Vermont with its constantly changing seasons. The environment here reminds me to be agile and adaptable with whatever comes my way.  As I finish my Computer Science degree at the University of Vermont and head into the professional world, I’m hoping to establish myself as a self-motivated independent contractor ready to meet a wide variety of client needs.</p>
