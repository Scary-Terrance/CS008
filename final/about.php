    	<p>My name is Ben Ventura. I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Vermont. This website was made as part of CS008, a web programming class in the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences.  I am taking CS008 to improve my web programming skills, and to get a solid foundation in PHP, a programming language for web applications.  After completing my Bachelor’s degree I would like to get a job working as a web developer.</p>

		<p>This web site runs on the Apache web server.  Apache loads PHP files and converts them into HTML to be served to the user’s web browser.  The PHP is split into different files which our routed between by the webserver using links within the HTML to find the PHP in the destination.  The Apache web server also serves files such as the image below, or the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) which defines the appearance of the webpage. The image above is a wireframe representing the layout and flow of this website.</p>

		<p>Coming into this class, I was already experienced with backend ender server side programming like Node.JS. I knew I needed practice with front end skills like CSS, and this class CS-008 at the University of Vermont provided the perfect opportunity.  As well as learning new front end skills, this class also gave me an opportunity to learn PHP — which is the most popular backend language, and will be a useful skill to have in the future. Going forward I plan to dig deeper with PHP by experimenting with different PHP frameworks like Wordpress.  Being able to make custom wordpress themes could be a useful skill to offer to future clients.  I would also like to learn more about the framework Laravel. Laravel is a powerful framework similar to Django in the Python programming language. Learning these skills would open a lot of opportunities with PHP.</p>
