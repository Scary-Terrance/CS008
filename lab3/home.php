				<h1>A Case for Safe Injection Sites</h1>
				<p>Vermont could benefit from more safe injection sites.  The opioid epidemic is deeply entrenched in Vermont.  Cities throughout the state are struggling with the impacts of severe drug addiction.  Among these consequences is an increase of infectious bloodborne illnesses like HIV as a result of needle sharing.  Safe injection sites are in the best interest of everyone simply for the purpose of public health.  By providing clean needles, which will be properly disposed of and not left to potentially expose others to illness, the shelters can reduce the number of infections in a community.</p> <br>
				<p>The other major function of a safe injection site is to save lives.  Many people view drug use as a moral failing, and hold little sympathy for addicts.  However, regardless of personal opinions on the matter, overdose deaths have ripple effects which reach out to everyone in a community.  The best outcome is that a person is able to find the help needed to overcome their addiction.  For many that chance never comes because an overdose takes away the opportunity for recovery.  People trained in the use of Narcan are often able to save people who overdose.  Safe Injection sites offer trained staff equipped with Narcan who can save users who overdose, offer training in the use of Narcan, and distribute clean needles and Narcan to the community.</p> <br>
