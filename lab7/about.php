				<p>My name is Ben Ventura.   I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Vermont.  This website was made as part of CS008, a web programming class available at The University of Vermont.  I am taking CS008 to improve my web programming skills, and to get a solid foundation in PHP, a programming language for web applications.  After completing my Bachelor’s degree I would like to get a job working as a web developer.  The purpose of this website is to give information on making the world a better place.</p> <br>

				<p>This web site runs on the Apache web server.  Apache loads PHP files and converts them into HTML to be served to the user’s web browser.  The PHP is split into different files which our routed between by the webserver using links within the HTML to find the PHP in the destination.  The Apache web server also serves files such as the image below, or the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) which defines the appearance of the webpage.   The image below is a graphic representing the layout and flow of this website.</p> <br>
